# K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-Classifier-Implementation-Analysis

This repository contains an implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification tasks. KNN is a simple yet effective non-parametric algorithm used for pattern recognition, recommendation systems, and various machine learning applications.

Features:
✅ Implementation of KNN from scratch and using scikit-learn
✅ Support for different distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.)
✅ Hyperparameter tuning for optimal K selection
✅ Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
✅ Visualization of decision boundaries

Dataset:
The model is trained and tested on MNIST dataset 
Feature scaling and preprocessing techniques are applied to improve accuracy.
